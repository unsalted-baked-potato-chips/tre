Extensions can:
    Hijack input
    Hijack display
    Define commands
    Define macros
    Execute commands
    Set Vars

Hijacks:
    The extensions can insert themselves as a sort of man in the middle
    Only one hijacker can be registered to a type at once
    
    Hijack input
        Extension will recieve new letter input, current line and position
        Sends back the the line and new position of cursor as it should be written
        Ideally cannot execute commands during this time (Mutex lock perhaps)

    Hijack display
        Extension will recieve the line, line position
        Sends back the new line with escape sequences
        tre interprets the escape sequences and displays the output

Define Text Command:
    Will define new command to act on selection
    Recieves selection on command execution
    Sends back edited selection

Define Macro:
    Defines a text substitution for a sequence of commands
    Does not require a second daemonized process. (Can be just a curl call at startup)

Vars:
   Not sure if this will stay. Might just be env vars. Might not exist at all.
   Things like tab character length, line buffer before start scrolling
   Does not need daemon.

Predefined Commands:
    q:
        Quit without saving
    w:
        Write to file
    e filename:
        Edit file
    ! command [args] [< selection]:
        Send selection to stdin of command
        Replace selection with stdout of command
